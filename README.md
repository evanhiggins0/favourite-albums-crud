# Favourite Albums - CRUD

Demo barebones CRUD app using Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

The app is designed to show the aspects of CRUD design, in a very simplistic manner.

To create this, I followed a tutorial posted here: https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/

I then applied this to my own idea. 

<u>The app does not have any style as of yet, as it is in the early stages of development
and I'm not sure as to what it will end up being just yet.</u>

<b>Run locally</b>

You must have Node.js and Express installed to run this application locally.

To check if you have these installed:
``` node -v```
 ```npm -v```
    
If you do not have these installed, you can check out how here:

https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

Once you have these installed, you can do run the app locally by executing the following in your shell:
```
git clone https://github.com/evanhiggins0/favourite-albums-crud

cd favourite-albums-crud

npm install

npm start
```
